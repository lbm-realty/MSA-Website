This website was created for my University's MSA, Muslim Students Association,to improve communication with students and make it easier for them to engage with the organization. It was initially supposed to be a very basic website where people could learn more about the MSA, and get involved. However, as time went by, I started giving a lot of focus to the design and the change between the routes, ensuring that it's easy for users to go from one page to the other. One of the most important things to implement was a donations page, for which I used the Stripe API. I fetched the data from the frontend and sent it to the backend (built using Node and Express) for Stripe to process the payment.

After completing about 90% of the website, I realized that the pages weren't flexible, as in, not adjusting well to different screen sizes. Hence, I took that into account and made it responsive. A little later I learnt about how useful react is, and it's prevalance when it comes to building frontend applications and decided to move the whole website to react.
